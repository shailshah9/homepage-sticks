# 📚 Collections Guide

## What are Collections?

Collections are themed groups that contain multiple related links. Think of them as folders or categories for your bookmarks, displayed as beautiful Boho-styled sticky notes.

## Why Use Collections?

### Before Collections (v1.0)
```
❌ Individual sticky notes for each link
❌ Hard to see related links together
❌ Cluttered when you have many links
❌ No logical grouping
```

### With Collections (v2.0)
```
✅ Group related links together
✅ See all links in a category at once
✅ Cleaner, more organized layout
✅ Easy to find what you need
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Collections Focused
✅ **Good**: "Work Communication" (Slack, Teams, Email)
❌ **Bad**: "Everything Work" (100+ mixed links)

### 2. Use Descriptive Names
✅ **Good**: "Frontend Development Tools"
❌ **Bad**: "Dev Stuff"

### 3. Limit Links Per Collection
- **Ideal**: 3-10 links per collection
- **Maximum**: 15-20 links
- **Too many?** Split into sub-collections

### 4. Color Code Meaningfully
Use colors to represent different life areas:
- **Lighter tones**: Personal/casual
- **Warmer tones**: Work/professional
- **Cooler tones**: Learning/growth
- **Darker tones**: Important/priority

### 5. Regular Maintenance
- Review collections monthly
- Remove dead links
- Update outdated resources
- Reorganize as needs change

## Collection Strategies

### Strategy 1: By Activity
Organize by what you're doing:
- Morning Routine (news, email, calendar)
- Work Session (tools, docs, projects)
- Learning Time (courses, tutorials)
- Evening Wind-down (entertainment, social)

### Strategy 2: By Project
One collection per project:
- Project Alpha (docs, repo, tasks, team)
- Project Beta (resources, planning, communication)
- Side Project (tools, inspiration, progress)

### Strategy 3: By Frequency
Organize by how often you use them:
- Daily Must-Haves
- Weekly Check-ins
- Monthly Reviews
- Reference Materials

### Strategy 4: By Context
Group by when/where you use them:
- Home Office
- Coffee Shop Work
- Mobile Quick Access
- Desktop Only

## Advanced Tips

### Nested Organization (Conceptual)
While the app doesn't support nested collections yet, you can simulate it with naming:
```
Work → Communication
Work → Development
Work → Documentation
Work → Management

Personal → Finance
Personal → Health
Personal → Shopping
```

### Quick Access Collections
Create a "⭐ Favorites" or "🚀 Quick Launch" collection with your most-used links across all categories.

### Temporary Collections
Create collections for temporary needs:
- "🎄 Holiday Shopping 2025"
- "🏖️ Vacation Planning"
- "📝 Tax Season"

Delete them when done!

### Backup Strategy
Regularly export your collections (feature coming soon) or take screenshots for backup.

## Troubleshooting

### "I have too many links in one collection"
**Solution**: Split into multiple themed collections
- Example: "Development" → "Frontend Dev" + "Backend Dev" + "DevOps"

### "I can't decide which collection a link belongs to"
**Solution**: 
1. Choose the primary use case
2. Or create a "Mixed/General" collection for miscellaneous links
3. Or add it to multiple collections (duplicate the link)

### "My collections are getting cluttered"
**Solution**:
1. Archive rarely-used links
2. Delete outdated links
3. Consolidate similar collections
4. Use more specific collection names

### "I need the same link in multiple collections"
**Solution**: Currently, add it to both collections. Future versions may support link references.

## Migration from Individual Links

If you're coming from v1.0 (individual links), here's how to organize:

1. **List all your links**
2. **Group by theme** (write on paper if needed)
3. **Create collections** for each theme
4. **Add links** to appropriate collections
5. **Review and refine** the organization

## Keyboard Workflow

Speed up your workflow:
1. `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → Focus search
2. Type collection or link name
3. Click to open
4. `Esc` to close any modal

## Visual Organization

Use the Boho colors strategically:
- **#E8D5C4** (Warm Tan): Work/Professional
- **#F4E4D7** (Soft Cream): Personal/Casual
- **#D4C5B9** (Cool Beige): Learning/Growth
- **#E5D4C1** (Peachy Tan): Creative/Fun
- **#F0E6D2** (Light Cream): Reference/Resources
- **#C9B8A8** (Deep Taupe): Important/Priority
- **#E0D5C7** (Neutral Tan): Mixed/General
- **#D9C9BA** (Warm Beige): Health/Wellness

## Success Metrics

You'll know your collections are working when:
- ✅ You can find any link in < 5 seconds
- ✅ You don't have "misc" or "other" collections
- ✅ Each collection has a clear purpose
- ✅ You use the search feature rarely
- ✅ New links have an obvious home
- ✅ You feel organized and in control
